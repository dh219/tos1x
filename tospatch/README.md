# TOSPATCH

This directory contains the TOSPATCH tool, along with
several useful patches. See the included documentation
on how to use it.

This program was not written by me, but most of the
patch files have been updated so they can be used with
other language versions than german.

# Known BUGS

The WINX patch will only work with the german version. Also, some
patches that replace single items in the resource files (like icons)
will only work with the german version for now. Replacing the whole
resource file should work though.

# Future

Some of the patches that can be applied can also be activated when
compiling the source. Others may follow.  See the file
[patchdef.h](/common/patchdef.h) for available options.
